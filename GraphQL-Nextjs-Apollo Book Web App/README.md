# Project Description
This project involves creating a GraphQL server using Apollo Server, with Redis for caching and MongoDB for data storage (using two collections: authors and books). The front-end application is built to interact with the server via Apollo Client. All queries and mutations are integrated into the project to demonstrate full CRUD functionality with the GraphQL API.
